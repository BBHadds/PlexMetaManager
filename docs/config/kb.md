Wondering how to troubleshoot Plex Meta Manager and how to read through the meta.log?

**Using a text editor like [Notepad ++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/) is very handy for this**

In all cases, the first steps you will want to do is open up the [`meta.log`](#meta.log-location) with your text editor and perform these three steps:

1. Check the version of Plex Meta Manager you are running and determine if you are running the latest [`version`](#plex-meta-manager-version). The [`most recent versions`](https://metamanager.wiki/en/latest/) can be found on the home page of the wiki for the latest, develop, and nightly branches. If not, [`upgrade`](https://metamanager.wiki/en/nightly/home/guides/local.html?highlight=upgrade#i-want-to-update-to-the-latest-version-of-pmm)
2. When scanning your meta.log file, search for `[CRITICAL]` items first as these will definitely need to be fixed
3. Scan your meta.log file for `[ERROR]` and make a note of the content of the full line to start your search below on how to resolve

### meta.log Location
The meta.log location: You can find your `meta.log` file within the `logs` folder of your Plex Meta Manager config folder [right next to `config.yml`].

### Plex Meta Manager Version
Checking the version: You will find that in your [`meta.log`](#meta.log-location) around the 8th-10th line and will look something like this:
